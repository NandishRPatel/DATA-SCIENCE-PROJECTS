### Executive Summary

Finance and banking are one of the most extensive and extremely competitive markets. Any organisation going face-to-face with the big players need to fortify that they understand precisely how buyers like to interact with their sales and marketing processes. Customers today lean on both online as well as offline means to shop before making a decision. Almost on every occasion, an offline phenomenon such as making a phone call or visiting a branch is a positive indicator of a possible conversion. In this report, a bank marketing dataset of a Portuguese bank is selected where the marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The report is based on the Bank Marketing Data from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). Initially, the dataset is split into training data, testing data and evaluation data. The data is imbalanced in terms of outcome categories. SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) was performed to handle the imbalance in the dataset. Various preprocessing techniques such as scaling, creating dummy variables were performed to make data suitable for modeling.  The outcome of the campaign is predicted using various classification and prediction models.
